                <p>The interview between Emann Odufu (Interviewer) and Auriea Harvey (Digital Sculptor) touches on the dawn of a new age in web art, web development and the possibilities that developing technology offers us. Harvey began with computers at home as a child copying code and debugging and has since transitioned into a more creative side of technology with her digital sculptures. After looking at her artworks and reading about her process in creating them while still holding fast to this concept of digital art holding the same value as art in real life. Harvey says “I don’t feel like the physical is ever severed from the digital. The actual sculpture is the digital model on my computer. That is the real sculpture.” This line truly made me think of the potential future there is for not only digital art but the digital world. But I believe art holds a special place, similarly to the way Harvey puts it because art is art whether it is digital or not. </p>
