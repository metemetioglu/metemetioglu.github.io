        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The readings were quite interesting as they refer to a topic that I have also been curious about. Limits of technological advancement are close to endless and every day new discoveries are made, sometimes rendering older versions to be outdated. Said versions were once our “high tech” and so one can only imagine what is to come. Yet there is the looming threat that privatization poses, specifically on the internet. In Tim Berners-Lee’s piece Long Live the Web he says “Large social-networking sites are walling off information posted by their users from the rest of the Web.” The allure of the internet in the early days is that people could simultaneously add to a webpage from countries away, forming a culture that encouraged collaboration but with companies putting up walls and hiding information away, this culture is at a disadvantage. These restrictions serve only to slow down the technological advancement of our shared society. I agree with his point that the internet must be accessible to all, in order to work towards collective growth.
