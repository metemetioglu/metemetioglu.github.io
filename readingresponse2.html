                    <h3>Episode 1 Response</h3>
                    <p>John Bergers take on the reproduction of works was fascinating to watch. For something aired in 1972, the piece's content stands relevant to this day and will most likely continue as so. He seemed to stand strongly against another man on the effects of reproduction on the value of a work. His stance painted the use of reproduction in a far nicer light, focusing on how advancements in the field have allowed us to appreciate and study the art on a much deeper level. I agree with his points on the value of the experience of going to see the original as a sort of journey/pilgrimage, enlightening and interesting, but not absolutely necessary.</p>

                    <h3>Episode 2 Response</h3>
                    <p>In the second installment of this series, Berger touches on the objectification of women in European art. Women are framed in these works fully naked in a manner that suggests that the  art is not in appreciation of the woman depicted but instead it highlights how the art was made for the viewer. After watching the film and seeing the evidence, it does seem like the power of many of these pieces is stripped from their subject, women and other men (including cherubs/boys to minimize power). Berger also invites women who watched his filming on this matter and takes a somewhat backseat while they discuss their takes on the subject. This is crucial because it gives us insight into the difference between how women view themselves and how they were being portrayed in this art.</p>

                     <h3>Episode 3 Response</h3>
                    <p>Berger’s next topic of conversation is the existence of early european oil paintings as a means to convey or boast ones wealth. We see various examples in this fragment of Ways of Seeing, of the amount of time and detail that artists would put into the items and surroundings of the subjects of the painting. Emphasizing this idea that the one commissioning the art is wealthy enough to purchase said items and the painting they’re in. Such paintings were given a value both social and monetary, something that needed to be kept safe. “Art galleries are like palaces, but they are also like banks” Berger states that across early european oil paintings and adverts from magazines alike, were are presented with things that are considered valuable and we are made to want them.</p>

                    <h3>Episode 4 Response</h3>
                    <p>In the final segment Berger speaks on the similarity between the Oil painting and the the modern advert. Many might find it unusual to place things of such disconnected time periods in the same category, but Berger argues otherwise. He claims that the goal of both piece are at least similar in the way that they are conveying this image of something to want. The difference between the two is that while the oil painting shows what the commissioner might own, or enjoy as a source of pleasure,the ads are creating a sense of something missing from the viewers life, some void that they need to fill. I never thought to compare the two forms but now that I’ve seen it from Berger’s point of view it seems to make sense.</p>
