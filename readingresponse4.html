                <p> Growing up I had always wondered how a series of simple drawings could show such fluid motion, I was mostly curious about the physical process of how Disney/Pixar could make such breathtaking animations all from storyboards, the field changed somewhat after the improvement of technology allowed for digital animation. I have done some animation, but mine has been limited to procreate and typically focuses on title cards and other production-related things. Thought after reading about the animation of characters in Disney's “12 Principles of Animation” I definitely want to experiment with character design and simple fluid movements one day. Using the array of tools provided to make sure that the animation is as realistic and appealing to the eye as possible. </p>
